# Configuration-System Backend Part
Please follow the instructions below to run the backend's API server.

## Run API server

```
cd ~/Configuration-System/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ~/Configuration-System
python -m backend.configuration.configuration_api
```

You only need to run *pip install -r requirements.txt* once in order to install all dependencies. When you want to run the API server again, you can omit those commands.
